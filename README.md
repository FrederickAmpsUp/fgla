# `fgla` - Fred's Graphics Library Abstraction

> ðŸŽ¨ `fgla` is a platform-agnostic graphics API/abstraction layer, inspired by WGPU and based on Vulkan.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `fgla` is still in its infancy, expect many breaking changes before working versions are published.

git submodule update --init --recursive
```
2. Add `fgla` as a CMake subdirectory:
```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
